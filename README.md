### Storyline for Lending Club

<ul>
  <li> Lending club is a peer to peer loan lending company which refers to the practice of lending money to individuals (small businesses) via online services </li>
  <li> Interest rates are usually set by an intermediary platform on the basis of analyzing the borrower’s credit(using features such as FICO score, employment status,
    annual income, debt-to-income ratio, number of open credit lines).</li>
  <li> The intermediary platform generates revenue by collecting a one-time fee on funded loans(from borrowers) and by charging a loan servicing fee to investors</li>
  <li> In addition,LendingClub categorizes its loans using a grading scheme (grades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G where grade A corresponds to the loans judged to be ‘safest’ by LendingClub). Of course, the safer the loan the lower the interest rate, and so investors have to balance risk and return when deciding which loans to invest in</li>
 <li> Different loan status:
   <ul>
     <li><i>Current</i> refers to a loan that is still being reimbured in timely manner </li>
     <li><i>Late</i> corresponds to a loan on which a payment is between 16 and 120 days overdue </li>
     <li>If the payment is delayed by more than 121 days,the loan is considered to be in <i>Default</i></li>
     <li>If LendingClub has decided that the loan will not be paid off, then it is given the status of <i>Charged-Off</i></li>
   </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
